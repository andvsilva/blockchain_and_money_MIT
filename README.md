### Study questions:
I will answer the questions based on the lectures of this course. 

- ### [Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn):
  - 1 - What is blockchain technology and why might it be a catalyst for change for the financial sector?
    - **My answer:** 
    The blockchain technology is a consensus protocol used to create an append-only log, being a transaction ledger that can them be used to form an auditable database:
      - Secured via cryptography:
        - hash functions for tamper resistance and integrity
        - Digital signatures for consent
        - Consensus for agreement
        - Addresses 'Cost of trust' (Byzantine Generals problem)
          - permissioned
          - permissionless (**BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM BLOCKCKAIN**)
        - Distributed Consensus
  - 2 - What do you as a student wish to learn from this course, ‘Blockchain and Money’?
    - **My answer:** 
      In this course I hope to learn blockchain technology and the money rules basics and how this will be inserted in the financial world to the future.

   - #### [What is money?](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2018/the-future-of-money-speech-by-mark-carney.pdf?la=en&hash=A51E1C8E90BDD3D071A8D6B4F8C1566E7AC91418)
        Adam Smith defines money by the roles it plays in society, in particular, how well it serves as:
        - **A store of value** with which to transfer purchasing power from today to some future time;
        - **A medium of exchange** with which to make payments for goods and services; and
        - **A unit of account** with which to measure the value of a particular good, service, saving or loan.

  - **Reading**: [The Impact of Blockchain Technology on Finance: A Catalyst for Change](https://voxeu.org/system/files/epublication/Geneva21.pdf)

- ### [Money, Ledgers & Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5auv_xrvoJk&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn&index=2&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWareMITOpenCourseWare)
    - 1 - What do the roles (medium of exchange, store of value, & unit of account) and characteristics (durable, portable, divisible, uniform, acceptable & stable) of money mean historically and in today’s digital economy?
      - **My answer:** 
        - The roles and characteristics of money are essencial to reach the 'sound money' whose
    intrinsic value is determined by the laws of the markets, the supply and demand laws. The sound 
    money allow the individual freedom and prosperity to the society. Today the sound money in one global digital economy will change the way the society works, allowing more people to participate in the 
    financial world, thanks to the technology capable to reproduce the roles and caracteristics of the physical money in a digital world. 

    - 2 - What is fiat currency, what are its ledgers, and how does it fit within the history of money?
      - **My answer:** 
        - *fiat currency* is a currency used by nacional economies, that is not backed by a physical commodity like gold. *Ledger* is a book or collection of accounts in which account transactions are recorded, or is basically a way to record economic activity, social relationship or financial relationship. *fit within the history of money*: fit currency is a nature consequence that was born in the social economy relationship in the society, where the money is a social construct or social consensus mechanism.
    - 3 - How does Bitcoin fit within the history of money, the emergence of the Internet and failed attempts of cryptographic payment systems?
      - **My answer:** 
        - The Bitcoin is a digital money or a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, being the first time in history of money was reproduced in a digital world, solving the classical problem in computer science, the '[double spending](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/double-spending-explained)', by using the internet protocols and the cryptographic hash functions. This is a basically a payment system that allow to the participate to make ecomonic transactions that are record in one ledger, the blockchain, where we have the privacy and liberty garanted by the cryptographic. 

      #### Good ledger:

      - Immutable
      - Consistency
      - Timestamp
      - Ownership
      - Acurracy
      - Description of the transaction
      - Comprehensive

      #### Fiat Currency

      - Social & Economic consensus.
      - Represented by central bank liabilities & commercial bank deposits.
      - Relies upon system of ledgerss integrated into fractional banking system.
      - Accepted for taxes.
      - Notes & Coins are legal tender for all debts public & privace.

      #### Characteristics of Money
      - Durable
      - Portable
      - Divisible
      - Uniform/Fungible

  - [Bitcoin - Technical Features](https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works)
    - Cryptographic Hash Functions
    - Timestamped Append-only Logs(Blocks)
    - Block Headers & Merkle Trees
    - Asymmetric Cryptography & Digital signatures
    - Addresses
    - Consensus through Proof-of-Work (PoW)
    - Network of Nodes
    - Native Currency (**Technological design feature that is part of the economic incentive**, Bitcoin mining)
    - Transaction Inputs & Outputs
    - Unspent Transaction Output(UTXO)
    - Scripting Language
  - 1 - What are the design features — cryptography, append-only timestamped blocks, distributed consensus algorithms, and networking—of Bitcoin, the first use case for blockchain technology? 
    - **My answer:**
        - *cryptography*: is methods and techniques to provide secure and protect information, in *append-only timestamped blocks* is a chain of block of data that are store in immutable way in time, using the concept called *distributed consensus algorithms*, where we do not have a central authority in the *networking*, where nobody has a control, but all the participants follow the protocol, the Bitcoin is a the first time in history that the blockchain technology are used to make money programming.
  - 2 - What are cryptographic hash functions, asymmetric cryptography and digital signatures? How are they utilized to help make blockchain technology verifiable and immutable?
    - **My answer:**
      - *cryptographic hash function* is an algorithm that makes an arbitrary amount of data input and produces
        a fixed-size output of enciphered text called a hash value, or just 'hash'. *asymmetric cryptography and digital signatures* is a way to encrypt a message to protect the information send through the internet, and only the people with the digital signatures can access the information encrypted. The blockchain technology is formated by the design features, where we have a ledger that record the economic transactions between the participants, and the data for each block of transactions are hashed with the timestamp and pratically infeasible to change (immutable), for one transaction we have the asymmetric cryptographic between parties, where one party use your digital signature to sign the transaction with your private key to another party (public key), and only this party with the private key link cryptographic to this public key will have access to the Bitcoin. This ledger (history of all transactions) is public and everyone can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
