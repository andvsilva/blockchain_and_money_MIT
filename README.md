### Study questions:
I will answer the questions based on the lectures of this course.

- ### [Introduction]():
  - 1 - What is blockchain technology and why might it be a catalyst for change for the financial sector?
   **My answer:** 
   The blockchain technology is a consensus protocol used to create an append-only log, being a transaction ledger that can them be used to form an auditable database:
    - Secured via cryptography:
      - hash functions for tamper resistance and integrity
      - Digital signatures for consent
      - Consensus for agreement
      - Addresses 'Cost of trust' (Byzantine Generals problem)
        - permissioned
        - permissionless (**BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM BLOCKCKAIN**)
      - Distributed Consensus
  - 2 - What do you as a student wish to learn from this course, ‘Blockchain and Money’?
    **My answer:** 
    In this course I hope to learn blockchain technology and the money rules basics and how this will be inserted in the financial world to the future.

   - #### [What is money?](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2018/the-future-of-money-speech-by-mark-carney.pdf?la=en&hash=A51E1C8E90BDD3D071A8D6B4F8C1566E7AC91418)
        Adam Smith defines money by the roles it plays in society, in particular, how well it serves as:
        - **A store of value** with which to transfer purchasing power from today to some future time;
        - **A medium of exchange** with which to make payments for goods and services; and
        - **A unit of account** with which to measure the value of a particular good, service, saving or loan.

  ### [Money, Ledgers & Bitcoin]()

    **My answer:**
    - 2 - What is fiat currency, what are its ledgers, and how does it fit within the history of money?
    **My answer:**
    - 3 - How does Bitcoin fit within the history of money, the emergence of the Internet and failed attempts of cryptographic payment systems?
