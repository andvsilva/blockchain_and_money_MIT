**scikit-learn** is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the `About us <https://scikit-learn.org/dev/about.html#authors>`__ page
for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

Website: https://scikit-learn.org

Installation
------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= |PythonMinVersion|)
- NumPy (>= |NumPyMinVersion|)
- SciPy (>= |SciPyMinVersion|)
- joblib (>= |JoblibMinVersion|)
- threadpoolctl (>= |ThreadpoolctlMinVersion|)

=======

**Scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.**
scikit-learn 0.23 and later require Python 3.6 or newer.

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with ``plot_`` and
classes end with "Display") require Matplotlib (>= |MatplotlibMinVersion|).
For running the examples Matplotlib >= |MatplotlibMinVersion| is required.
A few examples require scikit-image >= |Scikit-ImageMinVersion|, a few examples
require pandas >= |PandasMinVersion|, some examples require seaborn >=
|SeabornMinVersion|.

User installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``pip``   ::

    pip install -U scikit-learn

or ``conda``::

    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn

The documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_.

Testing
~~~~~~~

After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the source
directory (you will need to have ``pytest`` >= |PyTestMinVersion| installed)::

    pytest sklearn

See the web page https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/advanced_installation.html#testing
for more information.

    Random number generation can be controlled during testing by setting
    the ``SKLEARN_SEED`` environment variable.
