### Quiz:

  - Which of these statements is correct?
    - [x] A blockchain is a decentralized ledger which is continuously growing. 
  - Which of the following is not a requirement for Hash algorithms:
    - [x] A hash algorithm has to be only one-way (cannot be reverse-engineered)
    - [x] A hash algorithm has to be deterministic (same input generates same output every time).
    - [x] A hash algorithm has to have the Avalanche effect(any minor change to inputs changes the output completely and unpredictably)
- How does the "Distributed P2P Network" property of Blockchain enhance the security of this technology?
  - [x] Every participant of the network has a copy of the full blockchain and participants are synced up. Therefore, if an attacker modifies the blockchain on one of the computers in the network, they are modifying only one simple copy of the blockchain. The network will see this, compare it to prevailing majority of versions of the blockchain in the network and very quickly override the fraudulent version.
- Which of these is an accurate description of what Bitcoin mining is?
  - [x] Mining is all about finding a ```Nonce``` value which willl generate a Hash value below a certain target threshold set by the bitcoin network.
- What is a Consensus Protocol?
  - [x] A Consensus Protocol is a process used process to achieve agreement between participants of a distributed network.
